Program idea:
insert a sets of links in a txt file his name is Links.txt then using selenium to open that links one by one and scraping data from twitter.
i foucsed on ( Username - Name - DateJoined ).

it test the user:
if it suspended it will write suspended.

else if doesn't exsist it will write doesn't exsist.

else it will take the username in sesitive case if it sign in with capital or lower case and take the name that written in the page and date joined.

sometimes program get result not that you want but i will upgrade it in the future.

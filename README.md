( This Program just for educational purpose )
---------------------------------------------
Program idea:
insert a sets of links in a txt file name it as Links.txt , it will read all the links then using selenium libaray to open that links one by one and scraping data from twitter.
i foucsed on ( Username - Name - DateJoined ) , and it work as:

if the acoount is suspended it will write suspended.

if the account doesn't exsist it will write doesn't exsist.

if the account is valid it will take the username in sesitive case if it sign in with capital or lower case and take the name that written in the page and date joined.

sometimes program get result not that you want but i will fix it in the future.
